<h4>Q-in which year let and const introduce</h4>
<p>Before ES6 (2015), JavaScript had Global Scope and Function Scope. ES6 introduced two important new JavaScript
     keywords: let and const . </p>

     <h4>Q-why we need let and const in js</h4>
     
     <p>If you never want a variable to change, const is the
        keyword to use. If you want to reassign values: and
        you want the hoisting behavior, var is the keyword to use. 
        if you don't want it, let is the keyword for you.</p>

        <h4>Q-difference between let and const</h4>
        <p>var and let create variables that can be reassigned 
            another value. const creates "constant" variables 
            that cannot be reassigned another value</p>

            <h5>Q-const age =[21];<br>
                        age[0]=40;</h5>

<p>in this age will update in array because of reference 
    variable </p>

    <h5>Q-6 let age;<br>
        console.log(a);<br>
        age=20;<br>
        console.log(a);<br>

    </h5>
    <p>it will give error because of TDZ</p>

    <h4>Q- const age;<br>
        age=55;
    </h4>
    <p>it will give error because of
         we can only declare and initialize in same line </p>

    <h4>Q-what is Hoisting</h4>
    <p>Hoisting in JavaScript is a behavior
         in which a function or a variable 
         can be used before declaration</p>
