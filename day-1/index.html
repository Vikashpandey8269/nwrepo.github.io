<h1>difference between let var and const :-</h1>


<h4>1.scope let and const is block scope and  var is global and function scope .</h4>
<h4>2. we  can Declare let  and var without Initialization(let a,var a)
    but we have to Initialize const in one single line (const a=34) </h4>

<p>a.Initialization:- declare and assign a value  is called Initialization
</p>
<h3>ex:- let a =45;</h3>

<p>b.Declaration:- declare a value is called Declaration</p>

<h3>ex:- let a;</h3>

<h4>3. we can Re-declare and update value of var (var a=30, var a =20) <br>

    we can not Re-declare but we can update value of let(let b  = 40, b=20)  <br>
    we can not Re-declare and also we can't update value of const(let c=30 we cant not change it ) <br></h4>

<p>a.Re-declaration:- declare already declare value</p>
<h3>
    ex:- <br>
var a=30;<br>
var b=40 <br>
</h3>

<p>b.Update:- re-update the Initialize value</p>
<h3>
    ex:- <br>
    let b=30;  <br>
    a=40; <br>

</h3>


<h4>4. All three are hoisted </h4>


<h1>Hoisting</h1>

<h4>is  something which moves all the Declaration on the top of the scope  because of which i can access function and variable before its Declaration.</h4>
<h3>console.log(a) <br>
    var a =10;
</h3>
<h4>Note:- it doesn't moves its Initialization on top thats by it is giving undefined</h4>
