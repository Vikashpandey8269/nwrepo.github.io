    4,Array of object <br>

<h2> slice:-</h2>

<p> example:-  <br>
   const data =[0,1,2,3,4]   <br>

   data.slice(2,4)  <br>

   <h4>result:-2,3</h4> <br>

   it will return from index 2 to 3 only it will not consider index 4 <br>
   it will not change in original array <br>

</p>
<hr>
<h2>splice:-</h2>

<p>example:- <br>
    const data = [0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7]
    data.splice(2,2)
    data.splice(2,3 ,12,13,14)

    <h4>result:- 2,3</h4> <br>
   <h3> data.splice(2,2):-</h3><br>
    it will remove from 2nd index to 2 element means (2 and 3) will  from original array and return as answer <br>
    <h3>data.splice(2,3 ,12,13,14)</h3><br>
    it will remove from 2nd index to 3 element means (2,3 and 4)  will  from original array and return as answer  <br>
    but (12,13,14) will add in original array in place of remove array from index 2nd <br>

    it will change original array <br>

</p>

<hr>
<h2>switch:-</h2> <br>

<h3>The switch statement is a part of JavaScript's "Conditional" Statements,
     which are used to perform different actions based on different conditions.
     Use switch to select one of many blocks of code to be executed. This is the perfect solution for long,
      nested if/else statements.</h3>
<p>
    example:- <br>
    1,in switch statement if we don't add " break; " it will print all the result <br>
    2,we can use default any where in code it will considered as else statement <br>
